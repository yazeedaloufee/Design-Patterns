# Prototype Pattern

## Overview
The **Prototype Pattern** is a **creational design pattern** used to create objects by copying an existing instance (prototype) instead of constructing a new one from scratch. This helps improve performance and flexibility, especially when object creation is expensive.

## Implementation
### 1. Example one
The interface declares a `clone()` method implementing the cloneable interface.

### 1. Example two
The interface declares a `clone()` method without using cloneable interface.
